# ADVENT OF CODE 2024

This is my attempt to solve the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) using TypeScript.

Solutions are based on what I came up with when riding the train to work, so they might not be the most optimal solutions.

I add non-relevant comments along side the code to help me remember what I was thinking at the time.

In other words, this is not a tutorial, but a diary. XD

## Environment

I did this in nodejs v22.11.0 but should work with older versions.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Test

I'm using `jest` for testing.
Personally, I run the test with a vscode extension called `Jest Runner`.
OR with command.

```bash
npm test day_00
```
